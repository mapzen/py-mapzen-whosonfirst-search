# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-search

Python packages for talking to the Who's On First (spelunker) Elasticsearch index

## IMPORTANT

This library is provided as-is, right now. It lacks proper
documentation which will probably make it hard for you to use unless
you are willing to poke and around and investigate things on your
own.
